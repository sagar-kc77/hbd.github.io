        <p>Dear Sweetuuuuuuuu,</p>
        <p>
          You are the sweetest person I've ever met. Everything about you is so
          beautiful. I really love everything about you, your voice, face, hand,
          smile, cheeks, hair, nose, teeth, lips, expression, angerness your
          smile brightens my day, your kindness inspires me, and you have the
          most beautiful eyes. You are incredibly thoughtful, your love for
          adventure, the way you care for others, and your creativity amaze me.
          You make even the ordinary moments special with your sense of humor,
          your cute anger, your intelligence, your loyalty, and your infectious
          laugh. You make me a better person. Your sense of adventure, your
          passion for your interests, your strength, your honesty with me, and
          your warm heart all make my everyday better. Your sense of style, your
          attitude, the way you always make time for me, and your selflessness,
          your laugh—it all makes me happy. You are my safe haven, and your
          warmth is incredible. We’ve had so many beautiful memories, so many
          good moments, and some tough moments. I know I’ve made you sad at
          times, and I’m sorry. I’ve always considered you, and I’m always
          looking forward to making myself better. I can lose everything, but I
          can't lose you. I will try my best to achieve everything the way you
          want. I'm sorry for many things, and I love you, Prakriti, more than
          my life. Happy birthday, little princess. No matter how much you grow
          up, you will always be a little baby princess to me.❣️
